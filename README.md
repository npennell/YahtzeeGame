# YahtzeeGame

This is a simple iOS app version of Yahtzee. I am building this for practice using XCode and coding in Swift. 

# Prerequisites

This app is only functional on iOS currently.  

* Must be running XCode.   

# Installing YahtzeeGame

* Download as a .zip    
* Open the unzipped folder in XCode   

# Using YahtzeeGame

After opened in XCode, press the play button    

* Click the "Click to Roll" button to roll the dice   
* The dice can be tapped if you don't want them to be rolled, and they will turn grey   
* If you want to take a score, you touch the label for that score 
* Clicking the "New Game" button at the bottom of the screen will reset the game

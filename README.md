# YahtzeeGame

This is a simple app version of Yahtzee. I am building this for practice using XCode and coding in Swift. 

# Prerequisites

This app is only functional on iOS currently.  
Must be running XCode.   

# Installing

Download as a .zip    
Open the unzipped folder in XCode   

# How to Run

After opened in XCode, press the play button    

Click the "Click to Roll" button to roll the dice   
The dice can be tapped if you don't want them to be rolled, and they will turn grey   
If you want to take a score, you touch the label for that score
